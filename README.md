# Ansible & Vagrant local infrastructure development and deployment


# Introduction

[Vagrant + Ansible + virtual box]()
## Vagrant 

- This is a great tool for managing local virtual machines to mimic real world infrastructure locally or in the cloud.

## Ansible

- Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

- It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

- Ansible provisions servers managing their configurations & deploying applications either locally or in the cloud.


My plan it to develop this project in 2 phases.

**Phase 1:** Deploying locally.

**Phase 2:** Deploying to Google Cloud.

**Tools used:**
1. GitKraken - a Git GUI.

2. Debian based O.S.
