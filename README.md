# Ansible & Vagrant infrastructure development and deployment


# Introduction

![Vagrant + Ansible + virtual box](https://github.com/House-Of-Research/Ansible-Vagrant-local-infrastructure-development-and-deployment/blob/main/Images%20%26%20gifs/Vagrant-Ansible3.png)

## Vagrant 

- This is a great tool for managing local virtual machines to mimic real world infrastructure locally or in the cloud.

## Ansible

- Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

- It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

- Ansible provisions servers managing their configurations & deploying applications either locally or in the cloud.It works by pushing changes
  to all servers(by default)


My plan is to develop this project in 2 phases.

**Phase 1:** Deploying Ansible & Vagrant locally.

**Phase 2:** Deploying Ansible & Vagrant to Google Cloud.

## Tools used:

1. GitKraken - a Git GUI tool.

2. Debian based O.S (Parrot O.S).

3. VMWare Workstation.

## [Initial setup explained here:](https://github.com/Andrews-Projects/Ansible-Vagrant-infrastructure-development-and-deployment/blob/main/Initial-setup.md)
